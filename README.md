# API-DEMO
A quick demonstartion of an API using spring boot and swagger

## Compile

This is intended to be compiled using java 17 at a minimum

```
$ mvn clean install
```

## Run

In the target directory

```
$ java -jar api-demo*.jar
```
## Configuration

Configuration is in the internal application.properties file

server.port is set to 8081
## Swagger

Swagger is available at
```
localhost:8081/swagger-ui/
```

## How it works

The main is in __uk.co.rpl.exampleapi.DemoApplication__

### Controllers

There are two controllers

* __uk.co.rpl.exampleapi.controllers.HomeController__
* __uk.co.rpl.exampleapi.controllers.UserController__

and 1 exception handler
* __uk.co.rpl.exampleapi.controllers.ExceptionHandlers__

__HomeController__ only redirects / to swagger documentation, so Swagger docs should be found at __http://localhost:8081/__,
if you have not seen Swagger before it is an excellent way of automatically documenting an api, much more information
can be displayed than done here thrugh a whole range of annotations.

__UserController__ provides information about Users, there are within it a fixed list of 4 users, 
the controller routes three end points:

* __/api/user/{id}__ Get user identified by index 0 to 3 i.e. __/api/user/3__.
* __/api/main-user__ Get the first user, this is equivalent to __/api/user/0__.
* __/api/users__ This returns a list of all 4 users

In all cases the returned data for a User is just  the two fields __firstName__ and __lastName__.

__ExceptionHandler__ processes exceptions that are not caught before they leave the controllers.

It is marked with the annotation __@ControllerAdvice__ which indicates special controller configuration.

It only contains a single Handler which handles the NotFound exception thrown from the __UserService's__
__get(int id)__ method and hence from the __/api/user/{id}__ end point if id is out of bounds.

### Testing
There are 3 test classes
* __DemoApplicationTests__ only tests that te application does not fail to start up, and was autogenerated by InteliJ.
* __UserControllerTest__ tests the user controller, this uses the spring class MockMvc to mock the invocation of the 
__UserController__ as spring would whilst it is running.

In general the perform method of this clas takes a url, you can also specify headers and a body, though 
only the url is used in these cases.

The perform method returns a ResultActions class, you can use andExpect to test various aspects of the result.

* __UserServiceTest__ tests the user service class.
